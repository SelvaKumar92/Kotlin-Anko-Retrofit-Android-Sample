Why Kotlin ?

Kotlin is a JVM-based and Object-Oriented functional language. It is simple, easy to learn and have total integration with Android Studio.
Compared to Java 7, Kotlin have a lot of advantages. In fact, it is:
More expressive: More functionalities with less code.
Functional: it uses many concepts from functional languages such as lambda expressions
Extension functions: we can, without access to the source code of the class, extend it with new features.
Interoperable: You can use most of the libraries and code written in Java language.
Smart Cast: In many cases, one does not need to use explicit cast operators. String Templates: Strings may contain template expressions. A template expression starts with a dollar sign ($).
Safer: null safe, which give more control and prevent a lot of possible bugs.
Data Classes: for classes that do nothing but hold data, the compiler automatically derives equals(), hashCode(),toString(), copy() and componentN() functions corresponding to the properties.
And a lot more.
